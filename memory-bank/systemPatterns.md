# System Patterns: FitTracker

## Architecture Overview
FitTracker follows a client-server architecture with a React frontend and Node.js backend. The system is designed with separation of concerns, where the client handles UI interactions and the server manages data persistence and business logic.

## Component Structure

### Frontend (React)
1. **Pages**: High-level views that correspond to different application states
   - Home: Main dashboard with quick access to workouts
   - Exercises: List and management of exercise routines
   - Workout: Detailed workout session view
   - Landing: Entry point for new users

2. **Components**: Reusable UI elements
   - UI Components: Standard interface elements (buttons, forms, cards)
   - Feature Components: Specialized fitness tracking elements (timer, counter)
   - Layout Components: Structural elements (header, navigation)

3. **Hooks**: Custom React hooks for state management
   - useAuth: Authentication state management
   - useMobile: Device detection for responsive design
   - useToast: Notification system

4. **Libraries**: Utility functions and shared logic
   - authUtils: Authentication helper functions
   - queryClient: React Query client for data fetching
   - utils: General utility functions

### Backend (Node.js/Express)
1. **Routes**: API endpoints for client-server communication
2. **Database**: Drizzle ORM with SQLite integration
3. **Storage**: Data persistence layer
4. **Authentication**: Replit Auth integration

## Design Patterns

### 1. Component-Based Architecture
- Reusable UI components following React best practices
- Separation of concerns between presentational and container components
- Consistent component API design

### 2. State Management
- React Query for server state management
- Local component state for UI interactions
- Context API for global application state (authentication)

### 3. Data Flow Patterns
- Unidirectional data flow from parent to child components
- API-first approach with well-defined endpoints
- Optimistic updates for improved user experience

### 4. Authentication Pattern
- Replit Auth integration for seamless user experience
- Token-based authentication with session management
- Protected routes for secure access control

## API Design
1. **RESTful Endpoints**: Standard HTTP methods for CRUD operations
2. **Consistent Response Format**: Uniform structure for API responses
3. **Error Handling**: Comprehensive error reporting with meaningful messages
4. **Data Validation**: Input validation at the API level

## Database Schema
1. **Workout Table**: Stores workout routine information
2. **Exercise Table**: Contains exercise details and performance metrics
3. **User Table**: User profile and authentication information

## Security Patterns
1. **Input Sanitization**: Validation and sanitization of user inputs
2. **Authentication Middleware**: Protected route access
3. **Secure Data Storage**: Encrypted storage of sensitive information
4. **CORS Configuration**: Controlled cross-origin resource sharing

## Performance Patterns
1. **Caching**: Client-side caching with React Query
2. **Lazy Loading**: Code splitting for improved initial load times
3. **Optimized Rendering**: Efficient component re-rendering
4. **Bundle Optimization**: Minified production builds

## Error Handling
1. **Graceful Degradation**: Fallback behaviors for failed operations
2. **User-Friendly Messages**: Clear error communication to users
3. **Logging**: Comprehensive error logging for debugging
4. **Recovery Mechanisms**: Automatic retry logic for transient failures

## Testing Patterns
1. **Unit Testing**: Component and function level testing
2. **Integration Testing**: API endpoint validation
3. **End-to-End Testing**: User journey validation
4. **Mock Data**: Isolated testing environments

## Deployment Patterns
1. **Environment Configuration**: Separate configs for development/production
2. **Build Optimization**: Production-ready optimized builds
3. **Static Asset Handling**: Efficient asset delivery
4. **Health Checks**: Application status monitoring
