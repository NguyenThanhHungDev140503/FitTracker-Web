# Progress Tracking: FitTracker

## Current Status
Memory bank initialization in progress. Core documentation files have been created to establish the foundation for ongoing project development and context management.

## What Works
1. **Project Structure**: Basic FitTracker project structure is in place
2. **Frontend**: React application with TypeScript
3. **Backend**: Node.js/Express server with API endpoints
4. **Database**: Drizzle ORM with SQLite integration
5. **Authentication**: Replit Auth integration
6. **UI Components**: Basic UI component library based on shadcn/ui patterns
7. **Routing**: Client-side routing with React Router
8. **State Management**: React Query for server state management

## What's Left to Build
1. **Memory Bank**: 
   - [x] Create memory-bank directory
   - [x] Create projectbrief.md
   - [x] Create productContext.md
   - [x] Create systemPatterns.md
   - [x] Create techContext.md
   - [x] Create activeContext.md
   - [x] Create progress.md (this file)

2. **Feature Enhancements**:
   - [ ] Advanced workout analytics and reporting
   - [ ] Exercise recommendation system
   - [ ] Social features for sharing progress
   - [ ] Goal setting and achievement tracking
