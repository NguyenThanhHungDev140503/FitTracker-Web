# Active Context: FitTracker

## Current Work Focus
Initializing the memory bank for the FitTracker project to establish a foundation for ongoing development and documentation. This involves creating all required core documentation files that will guide future development decisions and maintain project context across sessions.

## Recent Changes
1. Created memory-bank directory structure
2. Established core documentation files:
   - projectbrief.md: Project overview and requirements
   - productContext.md: User experience and value proposition
   - systemPatterns.md: Architecture and design patterns
   - techContext.md: Technology stack and environment
   - activeContext.md: Current work tracking (this file)
   - progress.md: Project status and completion tracking

## Next Steps
1. Review and validate the initial memory bank content
2. Begin analyzing the existing FitTracker codebase structure
3. Identify areas for potential improvements or enhancements
4. Document any findings in the appropriate memory bank files
5. Establish a process for ongoing memory bank updates

## Active Decisions
1. Using Markdown format for all memory bank files for simplicity and readability
2. Following the hierarchical structure defined in the user's custom instructions
3. Focusing on capturing both technical and product context
4. Maintaining a balance between comprehensive documentation and practical usability

## Considerations
1. Ensuring memory bank files remain up-to-date as the project evolves
2. Making documentation accessible and useful for future development sessions
3. Capturing both high-level project vision and detailed technical implementation
4. Establishing clear processes for memory bank maintenance

## Current Priorities
1. Completing the initial memory bank setup
2. Understanding the existing FitTracker implementation
3. Identifying immediate opportunities for improvement
4. Establishing development workflows and best practices

## Key Questions
1. What are the most critical areas for improvement in the current implementation?
2. How can the memory bank be effectively maintained during ongoing development?
3. What additional context would be valuable to capture in the memory bank?
4. How should the memory bank evolve as the project grows?
